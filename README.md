This project is mostly for me to become familiar with using OpenAI APIs to send and receive prompts to ChatGPT, as well as running a webserver using fastAPI.

Fun fact, this was completely not what I was intended to do, as I was interested in working with google-adk, but the Cascade AI that I used to help me get this project running went in this direction, so I just full sent in this direction. Definitely was worth the investment, and I'm slowly getting back into the rhythm of coding after having been on hiatus for nearly a year.
